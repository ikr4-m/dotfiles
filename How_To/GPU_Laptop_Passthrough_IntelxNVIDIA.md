This tutorial is for laptop that iGPU is still connected to External Monitor/Dummy HDMI. If your laptop's dGPU connected to External Monitor/Dummy HDMI, this tutorial is not for you.

# Story Behind This Thing
I'm using gaming laptop with linux for working but I still want to be a "gamers". There's some limitation when I gaming in Linux especially the **Anti Cheat** that cannot be used with Proton. The same goes for productive apps like Adobe Premiere/After Effect or Microsoft Office that 100% not compatible with Wine.

*"Why not dual boot?"*

1. I must re-sync all the clock system in Windows and Linux when I'm switching the OS.
2. I must install the same app that I've use in Linux to Windows just for communication. Like Discord for gaming.
3. *This nerd blood is too strong in me...*

# Pros & Cons
For pros:
- Could be faster than dual booting (this is true in my case, it's depends on your system).
- You have ability to switch mode to Hybrid (Optimus) and Integrated (Isolated) with a single command line.
- Using virtual disk, you can bring it all the way.
- `virt-manager` running without sudo like the other tutorial.

For cons:
- This method using preallocated qemu-img that consume a bunch of storage for a better performance.
- You still have to reboot your laptop to switch your GPU.
- You'll need to change some source code from `envycontrol`.

# My Setup
For this tutorial, I'm using MSI Katana GF66 11UD with MUXless scheme and using Garuda Linux distributon. For the specs, you can search it in internet.

# Prerequisites
1. A laptop that can support VT-d/VT-g. Some Intel processor above 7th Generation have this feature.
    - Enable the Intel Virtualization in BIOS first before start geeking.
2. Installing QEMU with virt-manager. You can follow [this tutorial](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-kvm-qemu-virt-manager-arch-manjar/) for the step of installation.
    - After installing QEMU, install [QEMU Hooks](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-kvm-qemu-virt-manager-arch-manjar/) to automate bind/unbind the GPU.
3. [virtio-win drivers and guest tools.](https://github.com/virtio-win/virtio-win-pkg-scripts/blob/master/README.md) I suggest you to download the ISO file.
4. [spice-guest-tools.](https://www.spice-space.org/download.html#windows-binaries)
5. [Looking Glass, for better gaming.](https://looking-glass.io/)
6. [OPTIONAL] [Windows File System Proxy](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-kvm-qemu-virt-manager-arch-manjar/) to connect your local drive to the VM.

# Procedure
## Enable Intel IOMMU and Load VFIO Modules
1. Modify your kernel parameter (usually in `/etc/default/grub` if you using GRUB), and add:
```
intel_iommu=on iommu=pt kvm.ignore_msrs=1
```
Don't forget to update your GRUB after modify your kernel parameter.

2. Add this module to your initramfs: (in my case, I'm using dracut that location in `/etc/dracut.conf.d/`)
```
add_driver+=" vfio vfio_iommu_type1 vfio_pci vfio_virqfd "
```
Don't forget to update your initramfs after adding some module.

3. Restart your laptop.

## Disable NVIDA From Accessing X-Server
1. Check your GPU. You can use `lspci -nnk | grep -i nvidia` to check if your GPU is still be used by Nvidia/Nouveau module.
2. Copy all [envycontrol](https://github.com/bayasdev/envycontrol) setup.py code to your laptop.
3. Search this line of code:
```py
    if graphics_mode == 'integrated':
        cleanup()

        # blacklist all nouveau and Nvidia modules
        create_file(BLACKLIST_PATH, BLACKLIST_CONTENT)

        # power off the Nvidia GPU with udev rules
        create_file(UDEV_INTEGRATED_PATH, UDEV_INTEGRATED)

        rebuild_initramfs()
```
Give the command that generate file to power off the Nvidia GPU because we still need to use the GPU. The code will look like this:
```py
    if graphics_mode == 'integrated':
        cleanup()

        # blacklist all nouveau and Nvidia modules
        create_file(BLACKLIST_PATH, BLACKLIST_CONTENT)

        # power off the Nvidia GPU with udev rules
        #create_file(UDEV_INTEGRATED_PATH, UDEV_INTEGRATED)

        rebuild_initramfs()
```
4. [OPTIONAL, if you using Dracut] search this line of code:
```py
def rebuild_initramfs():
    # Debian and Ubuntu derivatives
    if os.path.exists('/etc/debian_version'):
        command = ['update-initramfs', '-u', '-k', 'all']
    # RHEL and SUSE derivatives
    elif os.path.exists('/etc/redhat-release') or os.path.exists('/usr/bin/zypper'):
        command = ['dracut', '--force', '--regenerate-all']
    # EndeavourOS with dracut
    elif os.path.exists('/usr/lib/endeavouros-release') and os.path.exists('/usr/bin/dracut'):
        command = ['dracut-rebuild']
```
Change `and` operator to `or` in `EndeavourOS with dracut` because the tools wont execute the dracut-rebuild if you're using dracut without using EndeavourOS distribution.

5. Copy or make symlink to `/usr/bin` and execute this command:
```
sudo envycontrol -s integrated
```
6. Reboot your laptop, check your GPU with `lspci -nnk | grep -i nvidia`. It should your GPU not using nvidia kernel module anymore.

Note: If you want to back to Hybrid mode, just execute this command again:
```
sudo envycontrol -s nvidia
```
And make it sure your GPU using nvidia kernel after rebooting.

Note2: *[Check this out](https://github.com/thatismunn/dotfiles/blob/46cef8ccd5be7096f485c3e650d281f4ec0a5bcc/.localscript/bashrc/alias.d#L17-L19), maybe you can follow my ~~lazy ideas~~.*

## Install KVM
You can follow the instruction for installation VM from [BlandManStudios video](https://youtu.be/eTWf5D092VY?t=468). Some people don't recommend this video because giving bad information or something. But if you want to see how to install an OS to QEMU, I think you can follow his tutorial.

For QEMU Hooks, here is some references that I use for my setup. **Don't copy-paste my hooks because maybe my scene is not same as you.**

`prepare/begin/start.sh`
```sh
#!/bin/bash
# Helpful to read output when debugging
set -x

# Stop Cloudflare WARP Service
systemctl stop warp-svc

# Unbind VTconsole
echo 0 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/bind

# Avoid a Race condition by waiting 2 seconds. This can be calibrated to be shorter or longer if required for your system
sleep 2

# Unbind the GPU from display driver
virsh nodedev-detach pci_0000_01_00_0

# Load VFIO Kernel Module  
modprobe vfio-pci  
```

`release/end/revert.sh`
```sh
#!/bin/bash
set -x

# Start Cloudflare WARP Service
systemctl start warp-svc

# Re-Bind GPU to Nvidia Driver
virsh nodedev-reattach pci_0000_01_00_1

# Rebind VT consoles
echo 1 > /sys/class/vtconsole/vtcon0/bind
```

After you install VM. Don't forget to install virtio-driver and spice-guest-tools for better VM QoL.

## Installing Looking Glass
You can follow the installation for setup IVSHMEM and KVM Permission from [Looking Glass wiki](https://looking-glass.io/docs/B6/install/) here. Here's some arguments reference to launch looking glass with my scheme:
```sh
# Launching Looking Glass with changing ScrollLock button to RightCtrl
looking-glass-client -m 97 -c DXGI
```

## [OPTIONAL] VirtIO FS
After installing virtio-driver, add `filesystem` hardware with `virtiofs` and specify your location in VM Manager.
